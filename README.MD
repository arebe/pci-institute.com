This satirical website was designed to expose the predatory nature of for-profit schools.

Data
----
Our analysis draws data from several sources to evaluate the current state of for-profit education. Those sources are summarized below.
- [Federal "90/10" data](https://studentaid.ed.gov/about/data-center/school/proprietary): we used 2012/2013 data about federal funding and overall funding at for-profit institutions to determine the aggregate support that they receive from the federal government.
- [Three-year Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools](http://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/cdr.html): the Department of Education tracks default rates for students who enter repayment after departing from for-profit schools.
- [IPEDS Data Center](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/login.aspx): the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System provides a trove of useful statistics describing the operation, demographics, and classification of college campuses. We found their data to be particularly helpful for comparisons between for-profit schools and all others.
- [Department of Education trend data](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cha.asp): Department of Education figures clearly illustrate the recent sharp increase in for-profit college enrollment.
- [The Center for Responsive Politics](http://www.opensecrets.org/): the CRP provides granular campaign finance data (through their [OpenData Initiative](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php) that helped us illustrate for-profit educators' donation behavior in the 2012 election.
